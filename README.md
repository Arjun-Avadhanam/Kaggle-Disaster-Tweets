This is a small repo that provides a basic model for the solution of the Kaggle Project-Disaster Tweets.
The project involves creation of a classifier that can successfully classify whether a person is referring to a natural disaster or not based on a tweet and some paramters(eg location etc)
Please check the competition and the dataset available on Kaggle for more information.

The project uses 2 seperate models:

1. A basic Deep Learning model with framework from TensorFlow.

2. An LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) model which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network(RNN)

From the results both methods provide a relatively similar accuracy.
